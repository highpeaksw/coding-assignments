Coding Assignment
Problem Statement : A factory has a list of jobs to perform. Each job has a start time, end time, and profit value. The manager has asked his employee Lokesh to pick jobs of his choice. Lokesh wants to select jobs for him in such a way that would maximize his earnings.
Given a list of jobs how many jobs and total earnings are left for other employees once Lokesh picks jobs of his choice.
Note: Lokesh can perform only one job at a time.

Input format:
Each Job has 3 pieces of info – Start Time, End Time, and Profit
The first line contains the number of Jobs for the day. Say ‘n’. So there will be ’3n' lines following as each job has 3 lines.
Each of the next ‘3n’ lines contains jobs in the following format:
start_time
end-time
Profit
start-time and end-time are in HHMM 24HRS format i.e. 9am is 0900 and 9PM is 2100

Constraints:
The number of jobs in the day is less than 100 i.e. 0<_n<_10
The start time is always less than the end, and Hours can go only up to 2359.
